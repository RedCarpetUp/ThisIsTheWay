**Work culture at RedCarpet**:
-   *Ownership* - If you are given a task (which might be as trivial as sending an email), make sure you do it... or you come and tell us that you were not able to do it. **Dont** silently ignore it. You are now a valuable member of one of the most disruptive startups in India. Take responsibility.

-   *Hands on & Low Ego* - As founders, we have still swept floors and cleaned generators using mop cloths. Anything from writing testcases to making phone calls is [your job]. Make it happen. We dont believe in caste system around work.

-   *Jugaad* - we encourage jugaad. Dont make things more complex than they need to be, just because they sound cool.
-   *Be a [**[Honeybadger]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvlalDNxccw)* - Never give up. (P.S. check out videos of honeybadgers on youtube!)
-   *Design for Honesty* - The design culture at RedCarpet is ["Design for Honesty"](https://www.redcarpetup.com/2017/11/29/design-for-honesty/). Make sure you read about that.

**People culture at RedCarpet**:
1.  Eliminate fear of reading code - writing code is very easy. Reading code is very hard. The best programmers in the world can read code fast ...not write it (like [Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)) We will fix this by working on different programming languages and frameworks for **everyone** ... even if that is not your main project area. Meaning - you will work on Android/Kotlin, Javascript/Reactjs, Postgresql/SQL and (Python/Flask or Python/Pandas).
2.  Learning to debate/disagree and align/commit with colleagues is a first order skill. You will write a [Memo](https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/) on a topic and present it (by speaking) to your mentor in person.
3.  Consistency - we will achieve hard standards of code consistency. Including expectation of IDE setup, git pull requests, etc.
4.  Strong career achievement - The best companies in the world prefer an [Achievement data](https://www.businessinsider.in/A-head-recruiter-at-Amazon-says-the-best-resumes-are-data-based-and-theres-an-easy-formula-you-can-follow/articleshow/65235908.cms) based criteria for selecting candidates for jobs. Your college just gives you rote skills. You will build your achievements here.


Machine Learning Culture at RedCarpet
====================================
We thought it was important to put here

We take inspiration from the team at Google Brain AI - possibly the best AI team in the world.

- https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/rules-of-ml/

>"do machine learning like the great engineer you are, not like the great machine learning expert you aren’t. Most of the problems you will face are, in fact, engineering problems. Even with all the resources of a great machine learning expert, most of the gains come from great features, not great machine learning algorithms".

Based on best practices from Google, the ML/AI work at RedCarpet focuses a lot on the data versus the algorithms side. As part of the core ML team at RedCarpet, you will be expected to spend 80% of your time on data (stored in large databases - so SQL is a must), 19% of your time on business problems and 1% of your time (or even lesser) on algorithms.

- https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-fail-as-a-data-scientist-3-common-mistakes/

Today's world in AI/ML & data science is fast evolving. As an organization, we must make tradeoffs in using services like https://cloud.google.com/automl/ (which claims *"Train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimal effort and machine learning expertise."*) to https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/ (which claims *"enables developers to build applications with the same machine learning (ML) technology used by Amazon.com for real-time personalized recommendations – no ML expertise required."*) to https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing (which does image processing at $1 for 1000 images). 

So where does the true value of a data scientist lie when algorithms are commodity ? Its in the **business understanding**

**Business thinking + ML at RedCarpet**

Successful ML professionals at the best ML companies spend  a significant amount of time in understanding the business and product. Because a data scientist needs to understand the business for which they are building. Have you used RedCarpet's app ? What data science can you do there ?

If you work at RedCarpet, you will be asked to present your ML and data science in this way - https://rapidminer.com/resource/present-machine-learning-models/

We strongly believe in no exaggerated differences between **"data scientist vs data analyst vs data engineer"**.

NOHELLO policy on Slack
====================================
```
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello.
## CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
```
 Dont just say "Hi!" and then put them on hold. Instead do this.
 
 ```
 2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
```

Paraphrasing from nohello.com

- You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.
- The same goes for "Hello -- Are you there?", "Hi Bob -- quick question.", "Do you have a sec ?", "yt?" and "ping". Just ask the question!

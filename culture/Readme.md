**Work culture at RedCarpet**:
-   *Ownership* - If you are given a task (which might be as trivial as sending an email), make sure you do it... or you come and tell us that you were not able to do it. **Dont** silently ignore it. You are now a valuable member of one of the most disruptive startups in India. Take responsibility.

-   *Hands on & Low Ego* - As founders, we have still swept floors and cleaned generators using mop cloths. Anything from writing testcases to making phone calls is [your job]. Make it happen. We dont believe in caste system around work.

-   *Jugaad* - we encourage jugaad. Dont make things more complex than they need to be, just because they sound cool.
-   *Be a [**[Honeybadger]**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvlalDNxccw)* - Never give up. (P.S. check out videos of honeybadgers on youtube!)
-   *Design for Honesty* - The design culture at RedCarpet is ["Design for Honesty"](https://www.redcarpetup.com/2017/11/29/design-for-honesty/). Make sure you read about that.

**People culture at RedCarpet**:
1.  Eliminate fear of reading code - writing code is very easy. Reading code is very hard. The best programmers in the world can read code fast ...not write it (like [Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat at Google](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)) We will fix this by working on different programming languages and frameworks for **everyone** ... even if that is not your main project area. Meaning - you will work on Android/Kotlin, Javascript/Reactjs, Postgresql/SQL and (Python/Flask or Python/Pandas).
2.  Learning to debate/disagree and align/commit with colleagues is a first order skill. You will write a [Memo](https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/) on a topic and present it (by speaking) to your mentor in person.
3.  Consistency - we will achieve hard standards of code consistency. Including expectation of IDE setup, git pull requests, etc.
4.  Strong career achievement - The best companies in the world prefer an [Achievement data](https://www.businessinsider.in/A-head-recruiter-at-Amazon-says-the-best-resumes-are-data-based-and-theres-an-easy-formula-you-can-follow/articleshow/65235908.cms) based criteria for selecting candidates for jobs. Your college just gives you rote skills. You will build your achievements here.

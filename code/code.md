**Two Laws of Software Engineering:** 
At RedCarpet we believe in two sacrosanct laws of software engineering. These can never be violated. Make sure you memorize these.
1.  "*It is much harder to read code than to write it*" - Anyone can write code. Very few can read code. The popular opinion is that "Creating a new software project is the impactful work. Fixing bugs is boring". The reality is that - fixing bugs is not boring. It is much harder since you need to read existing code and understand it. A hundred monkeys can write the code that you can. But only a great engineer can read code. It is very easy to write code/proposals/designs. It is very hard to read someone else's code/proposals/designs. At RedCarpet we recognize that a lot of poor decisions that are made is because of this problem.
    - Corollary - The more code you read, the better engineer you become. Read a lot of code on Github.
    -  Make it easy to read code. Write testcases.
2.  "*Premature complexity is the root of all evil*" - Only write as much code as is required to solve the problem. Dont build something extra to make it look "cooler". Dont use Tensorflow if a python script is sufficient.
    -  Corollary - never tell us "*I have written the code, but not run it*". If you have written one line/function of code, you better have run it.

# Reading code is hard. Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago ?
[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/papers/p101-yoon-VLHCC2014.pdf](Why is it so hard to see code from 5 minutes ago)
>A study found that Java developers backtracked every 6 minutes, meaning.. by clicking undo or pressing Ctrl-Z.

Answer: **Spend time in setting up tools - editor, debugger, etc. They are more important than writing code**

Never EVER try to do these 3 things by hand. Use a library. Or you will suffer a lot. Very painfully.

**how to create a ssh key for github**
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email-address-that-you-used@github.com"`

this will ask you for a filename and creates two files: `filename` and `filename.pub` . These two files are used in different places. Be careful. (`.pub` files are set outside - share with your company, set in github, etc. never share the `filename` itself)

set this `filename.pub` key in github - [https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

set this in your `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host github-redcarpet
   HostName github.com
   IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/filename
   IdentitiesOnly yes
```
This basically means that use `filename` whenever a url named `github-redcarpet` is seen in any repository. This will mean your git command will automatically choose the correct ssh secret key to connect.

normally you would add a new repo (or clone it) using `github.com`. But now you should use `github-redcarpet`. E.g.

`git remote add origin git@github-redcarpet:redcarpetup/myrepo.git`

or

`git clone git@github-redcarpet:redcarpetup/myrepo.git`

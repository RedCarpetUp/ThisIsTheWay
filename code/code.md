**Two Laws of Software Engineering:** 
At RedCarpet we believe in two sacrosanct laws of software engineering. These can never be violated. Make sure you memorize these.
1.  "*It is much harder to read code than to write it*" - Anyone can write code. Very few can read code. The popular opinion is that "Creating a new software project is the impactful work. Fixing bugs is boring". The reality is that - fixing bugs is not boring. It is much harder since you need to read existing code and understand it. A hundred monkeys can write the code that you can. But only a great engineer can read code. It is very easy to write code/proposals/designs. It is very hard to read someone else's code/proposals/designs. At RedCarpet we recognize that a lot of poor decisions that are made is because of this problem.
    - Corollary - The more code you read, the better engineer you become. Read a lot of code on Github.
    -  Make it easy to read code. Write testcases.
2.  "*Premature complexity is the root of all evil*" - Only write as much code as is required to solve the problem. Dont build something extra to make it look "cooler". Dont use Tensorflow if a python script is sufficient.
    -  Corollary - never tell us "*I have written the code, but not run it*". If you have written one line/function of code, you better have run it.
    
#Learn this    

-   Markdown - [https://www.markdowntutorial.com/](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
-   Git (**expected time: half day)** - finish the quick guide. Show the result to your mentor. [http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). If you are on Windows, we suggest using [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). DO NOT USE ANY GUI.
        -   Create a dummy repo on github.
        -   Create a [README](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/) file in your repo.
        -   Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) on github. You will be asked to use this later.

Assuming you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Please don't use Sublime Text/Pycharm unless you're paying for it!).

## Must have addons

* [ErrorLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

## Good to have addons

* [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
* [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## How to

Add the contents of settings.json to your current [settings.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations). Restart VS Code for Magic.

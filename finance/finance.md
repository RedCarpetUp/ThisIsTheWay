How to value revolving credit
-------------------------------

From [https://mittalrohit.com/lessons-in-raising-debt-capital-for-lending-company-founders-7caececc34c](https://mittalrohit.com/lessons-in-raising-debt-capital-for-lending-company-founders-7caececc34c)

    For revolving credit programs, a heuristic that is useful in figuring out what percentage of your customers and receivable will be revolving, and using that as a multiple of your APR to find your break even point on your debt.

    So if your cost of funds is 8% and 15% of your customers revolve monthly, that ends of up being roughly 30% of your receivables at the end of the month. This leads you to an approximate cost of funds of 26.67%. While not an exact number, this is an approximate APR where you will break even on the portfolio at large.

<h3>Make Docker autostart</h3>

Run:
<code>sudo visudo</code>

This will open your /etc/sudoers file, which controls how sudo command are executed. Weâ€™ll want to allow our user to start docker without being prompted for a password. Add the following line to the bottom:

<code>\<username> ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service docker *</code> - Replace <username> with your system's username.

Make Docker start by adding it in your profile file. This will run this command everytime you open the terminal.

  <code>echo 'sudo service docker status || sudo service docker start' >> ~/.bashrc</code>
